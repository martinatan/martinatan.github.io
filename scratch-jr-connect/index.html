                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>I was project manager, UX designer, and web developer for a team of 3-5 at DevTech Research Group. I led the end-to-end feature design and development of a Wordpress site for educators and parents to share resources related to teaching ScratchJr.</p>
                        
                    <p>In addition to defining the appearance and layout of site features, I initiated development of the design into a functioning Wordpress site. This involved </p>

                    <p>In May 2021, we launched the live site at <a href="https://connect.scratchjr.org">scratchjrconnect.tufts.edu/</a>. It now hosts 1300+ registered users, and 100+ approved resources that are free to the public!</p>

                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <h2>How might we allow educators to access DevTech-approved teaching materials related to ScratchJr?</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was inactive at DevTech for some years before I took it on as an independent study in order to apply UX design skills that I had primarily learned outside of classes.

                </p>

                <p>My goal was to <strong>create a functional website</strong> that allows users to submit resources pertaining to <a href="https://scratchjr.org/">ScratchJr</a>, which is a tablet-based application for children ages 4-7 years old to learn to program while exercising their creativity and making engaging animations. The website needed to be scalable to serve possibly millions of existing educators who teach using ScratchJr in their classrooms or at home.</p>
