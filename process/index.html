			<p>Whenever I am developing a new project, regardless of whether it is a painting or a website, I start out by taking notes and journaling. I like to organize new information on paper as soon as possible, so I take notes at virtually every meeting or lecture I'm present for. Especially in my art practice, writing out what I'm feeling helps me check in with my instincts and start the process of making informed decisions about the project.

			<p>Research goes hand in hand with all my writing, as I often follow up on meetings or initial prompts with more questions for my collaborators. For me, it's reassurance that I am getting to know my client and clarify the problem before I trek too far down a wrong path. Thus, I approach every project with a curiosity for both the perspectives and methods that shape an end-product. Research, especially in the form of user feedback, continues to be an important consideration as I create first drafts.

			</div>
			<p>I don't get too far with just putting my ideas into words, so my sketching often starts as early as the first meeting with a client. When designing a logo, I fill pages of my sketchbook with many variations of a few instinctive ideas, choosing to modify a detail at a time. I adore sketching with teammates, too, using the quick-and-dirty language of wireframing to communicate user-flow schematics. Drawing was my first love, and it persists as the most efficient way to visualize my thoughts before I resort to grappling with digital software tools.

			<p>I use Sketch, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop to create vector-based graphics, and Figma to collaborate on interactive prototypes that are then referenced to build the functional platform. Iterating is an important principle from start to finish because it encourages a flexible timeline for critiques and subsequent improvements. I greatly enjoy that the design process is so flexible yet unpredictable, allowing me to move between stages with creative agency while maintaining a goal-oriented work ethic.
