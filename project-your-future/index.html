                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        For a design course on <i>Learning in Museums</i> at Carnegie Mellon University, my team collaborated with a local Pittsburgh museum to design a learning experience that would bring an Anthropocene perspective to their natural science galleries. Working from an open-ended design brief, we conducted generative field research and prototyped an exhibition concept that taught systems thinking and human stewardship through an interactive, animated projection.

                    <p>
                        I led the development of an <a href=”https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uPAa_J77cy-EeN5YgA1JAWQeCuo1hgUr/view?usp=sharing”>experience map</a> to describe the visitor touchpoints of our concept. I was also responsible for writing interview guides that appropriately measured visitor attitudes and knowledge about the human systems that drive climate change, and potential actions to mitigate climate risk.

                    <p>
                        Our team demonstrated this prototype to an audience of over a dozen exhibitions staff at the museum. Using analysis from our evaluative testing, we made design recommendations for staff to reference when tackling Anthropocene values in future exhibits.
