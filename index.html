			<p>I'm from Mount Laurel, New Jersey, but I'm currently earning a <a href="www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci">Master in Human-Computer Interaction</a> at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

			<p>
				In 2021, I graduated with two degrees in <b>Cognitive and Brain Science</b> and <b>Interdisciplinary Studio Art</b>, plus a <b>Computer Science</b> minor, as a <a href="https://smfa.tufts.edu/undergraduate/combined-degree">Combined Degree</a> student at Tufts and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts.

In 2021, I’ll be graduating with two degrees in <b>Cognitive and Brain Science</b> and <b>Interdisciplinary Studio Art</b>, plus a <b>Computer Science</b> minor.-->

		  	<p>Design and art have been my most persistent passions since elementary school, when I would jump at any chance to meticulously sketch and hand-write all of my project posters. I still love all manners of creating by hand, but I've also expanded my toolbox into the digital realms of programming and prototyping. I hope to have a career in Human-Computer Interaction or UX Design while maintaining a steady art practice.</p>

		  	<p> I find joy in collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds throughout my design process, with the goal of achieving solutions that are inclusive, audience-conscious and accessible.</p>

		  	<p>When I'm not sketching, I'm usually <a href="/projects/senior-thesis">thinking about tree bark</a>, scrolling on Tumblr, or consuming speculative fiction/fantasy stories. I use she/her pronouns.</p>
