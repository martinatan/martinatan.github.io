                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>As a project manager, UX designer, and web developer, I led the end-to-end UX design and development of a Wordpress site for educators and parents to share resources related to teaching ScratchJr.</p>
                        
                    <p>In addition to defining the layout of site features, I led the process of building them into a live website. I adapted Wordpress plugins for custom features, prioritized tasks for a team of 3-5 developers, and met frequently with tech support to troubleshoot bugs.</p>

                    <p>In May 2021, we launched the live site at <a href="https://connect.scratchjr.org">scratchjrconnect.tufts.edu/</a>. It now hosts 1300+ registered users, and 100+ approved resources that are free to the public!</p>

                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <h2>How might we allow educators to access DevTech-approved teaching materials related to ScratchJr?</h2>
                <p>
                    I took on this project as an independent study, hoping to apply UX design skills I was learning on my own. I picked up on previously conducted UX research by Hyejin Im and Eddie Futterman. I initially used these prior insights to rework the site’s UI design and determine its tech stack.
                </p>

                <h5>My Goal</h5>
                <p>Launch a functional website that allows users to submit resources pertaining to <a href="https://scratchjr.org/">ScratchJr</a>, which is an educational app that helps young children gain literacy in coding. The website needed to be scalable to serve possibly millions of existing educators who teach using ScratchJr in their classrooms or at home.</p>

                <h5>Why It Matters</h5>
                <p>
                    For years, ScratchJr users have reported <strong>a need for teaching materials recommended by a verified source</strong>. Devtech Research Group is one of few authorities on ScratchJr best teaching practices, and has not had a central platform for making these recommendations. Providing such a platform would <strong>reduce the work time</strong> that ScratchJr representatives spend manually addressing individual requests, while <strong>minimizing frustration</strong> for educators who normally have to track down a perfect lesson plan on their own.

                <h5>What we learned from 5 usability tests</h5>

                        <strong>High-level categories for resources were overcomplicated:</strong> Although generative research suggested we should sort resources into 5 categories, users reported confusion about the distinction between "Lessons" and "Activity Plans". This fueled later discussions where we finally settled on just two categories, “Activities” and “Project Showcase”. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Educators want to verify the science behind ScratchJr:</strong> Users wanted to learn more about the “PTD Rating” out of five stars that every resource received from Devtech. This pushed us to provide clarity in how we displayed this rating—a five-star system wasn’t sufficient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Internet speed greatly affects user adoption: </strong>One participant pointed out that most schools have slow wi-fi, making every successive page-load a hindrance to successful submission. We decided to spread the Submit process across fewer pages, to prevent users giving up halfway through.

                    I learned firsthand the drawbacks of jumping too quickly into Figma. Although we uncovered a lot from think-alouds with a high-functioning prototype, it was heartbreaking to implement major insights from our research and completely scrap the screens we had spent weeks on. I've now learned to test sketchy wireframes before moving onto higher fidelity prototypes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This need for speed extends to our testing process. Now that I swear by affinity diagramming, I would re-do this project with a scrappy mindset so I could feel more empowered to routinely speak with more users.
