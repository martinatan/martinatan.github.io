   	  	<p class="blurb">I am planning and implementing a community-based, site-specific art project with the aim of generating introspection about our relationship with trees and the environment. As part of my BFA senior thesis, I am working with my cohort to put on an end-of-year exhibition to show all of our work.</p>

    	</ul></p></center>

		<p class="indent">For my senior thesis, I am interested in the function and semiotic qualities of skin, namely the “skin” of trees—that is, tree bark. The skin defends against external, potentially harmful substances, and unhealthy skin invites disease into the body, or signals that disease has already breached it. In this current moment where disease is a central theme of the public health sphere as well as environmental and sociological contexts, it is crucial to embrace empathy and interconnectedness with regards to the world around us. This manifests in how I interface with the natural world.</p>

		<p><i>Treehugger</i> is a site-specific project which enables a process of identification and recovery as I curate a human-sized “skin” that hugs the trunk of a dead but otherwise intact tree on the Tufts University campus, reminiscent of tree-hugging interventions in environmental activist movements. I want to express my impulse to personally protect and honor the natural environment. To redress the tree’s vulnerability and loss of identity, I plan to “graft” impressions of various tree barks onto the trunk as though attempting to reverse the damage caused by others before me. The skin will be a portable assembly of handmade paper, which will be cast, colored, and drawn on to emulate barks of tree species.</p>

<div class="section">

<p><b>Community Participation:</b> To involve my friends and fellow artists in this project, I plan to send out handmade sheets of recycled paper on which volunteers can draw or write on and send back to me. Each volunteer will receive a package from me containing a handmade sheet and an instruction card that asks the following:</p>

<p><ol>
	<li>Set aside about an hour.</li>
	<li>Go on a walk, sit with a tree, visit a pond or river with the goal of slowing down to use all senses and take in your world. Potential questions to ask yourself:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>How do you feel connected to nature and to your own skin via your senses or via your life experiences?</li>
		<li>Pick a plant, animal, or area from your walk. What relationship or memories do you share with it? If you have none, why not?</li>
		<li>What in the world allows you to breathe? To feel protected?</li>
	</ul>
	<li>On one side of the handmade sheet, create a drawing of what you see or how you feel. This could range from a bark rubbing or observational sketch, to a scene from your own head, to just experimenting with scribbles and feeling your pen on the paper.</li>
	<li>On the other side, write the date and what comes to mind in response to the questions from step 2. Identify yourself on the sheet in whatever way you'd like.</li>
	<li>Send the sheet back to Martina.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>The final skin will include sheets from this community initiative. I hope that this component will allow others to indulge in a process of meditating on humans’ relationship to nature, and the power of collective healing and protection.</p>


<p>This project proposal is the winner of a $500 Dean's Research Grant from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. I will be creating handmade sheets of paper and mailing them out to volunteers through February, and hope to have the project's initial installation finished in March.</p>
