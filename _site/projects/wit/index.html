		<p class="indent">The first time I tried to design this logo, I felt rather restricted in coming up with appropriate symbolism for the conference and its mission. I had a case of designer's block where my only ideas involved the stereotypical "female" symbol, and I realized that the logo design did not have to so literally signal "womanhood", especially if what we <i>really</i> wanted to celebrate was women and nonbinary people. This is when I went back to the drawing board with the intent of doing more research.</p>

    	<p style="text-align:justify;">I then had some very open discussions with the organizers and the head of marketing for the 2018 conference. Who exactly is the conference for, and how do we position this event as a form of feminist action? How does branding play a role in inviting people of marginalized identity to participate and not just white, cisgendered women? What limitations need to be acknowledged now, so that they can inform the marketing? These are complex questions that we knew could not all be answered, but I found them important as I was thinking about the visual vocabulary for the branding. </p>

    			<div class="desc">Alternate, less simplified logo</div>
    			</center>
    		</div>
    	</div>

    	<p style="text-align:justify;">With the organizers' blessing and a lot of thinking and Pinterest boards, I made some sketches with a more gender-neutral appearance, using the imagery of a lightbulb and circuitry, and sometimes incorporating a "W" or coding braces. These elements center more around the themes of person-to-person connection that we hoped to foster at the conference.

    		</div>
    	</div>

    	<p style="text-align:justify;">For the 2018 conference I had come up with a simple lightbulb logo highlighted by an offset, yellow background color that pulled it all together and also informed the rest of the branding. I chose to use purple, teal, and yellow as a nod to the boldly-colored branding of other tech events. The palette also has a history of use as purposefully less traditionally feminine colors. The downside to this palette was the eye-strain and lack of contrast that made the design less appealing in retrospect.</p>

    	<p style="text-align:justify;">Still, the 2018 conference was successful and I was lucky to join the marketing team again in 2019 and reimagine my work from before. With feedback from my teammates, I experimented with many color palettes and settled on an expanded but cohesive suite of options that are hopefully easier on the eyes. From there I took the time to make a wide variety of graphics and branding materials that others could use as jumping-off points.</p>

    	<p style="text-align:justify;">Since joining the marketing team for Women in Tech in 2018, the conference has been one of my favorite experiences. It's incredibly rewarding to have played such a huge part in boosting the visibility of an event like this, which I've also been able to enjoy as an attendee.</p>
