			<p >I'm from Mount Laurel, New Jersey, but I currently split my time between <a href="https://www.tufts.edu">Tufts</a> and the <a href="https://smfa.tufts.edu/">School of the Museum of Fine Arts</a> as a fifth-year <a href="https://admissions.tufts.edu/academics/school-of-the-museum-of-fine-arts-at-tufts/combined-degree-with-the-schoo/">Combined Degree</a> student. In 2021, I’ll be graduating with two degrees in <b>Cognitive and Brain Science</b> and <b>Visual Art</b>, plus a <b>Computer Science</b> minor.</p>

		  	<p>Design and art have been my most persistent passions since elementary school, when I would jump at any chance to meticulously sketch and hand-write all of my project posters. I still love all manners of creating by hand, but I've also expanded my toolbox into the digital realms of programming and prototyping. I hope to pursue a career in Human-Computer Interaction or UX Design while maintaining a steady art practice.</p>

		  	<p> I find joy in collaborating with people of diverse backgrounds throughout my design process, with the goal of achieving solutions that are inclusive, audience-conscious and accessible.</p>
