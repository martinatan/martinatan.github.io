			<p>Whenever I am developing a new project, regardless of whether it is a painting or a website, I start out by taking notes and journaling. I like to organize new information on paper and in my memory as it comes to me, so I take notes at virtually every meeting or lecture I'm present for. Especially in my art practice, writing out what I'm feeling helps me check in with my instincts and start the process of making informed decisions about the project.
