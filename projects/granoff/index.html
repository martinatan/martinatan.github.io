    	<p class="indent">Upon joining the planning committee that coordinated this event, I had recently won Sketch through a design hackathon and wanted to try using it for this poster. Despite Sketch being a prototyping software, it has a powerful vector-drawing system that in some ways became more intuitive to me than Illustrator. That being said, designing this really got me comfortable with manipulating shapes and text in many ways. </p>
    	<p style="text-align:justify;">When thinking about how to arrange all the different information on this poster, I looked to posters for various music festivals which often list dozens of artists and must convey the personality of the festival. I'm pleased with my collections of ocean motifs, although if I were to make a festival poster again I would incorporate more high-energy, illustrative elements that I find so appealing in festival posters.</p>
